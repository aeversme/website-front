**Personal Website**

A #100DaysofCode project

This repo hosts the code for my personal website, coded with HTML5 and CSS3. This project was used to teach HTML 
and CSS concepts as an introduction to using Python for web scraping.

A GitHub Action will upload this code to an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket for static website hosting and invalidate 
the domain's associated CloudFront distribution each time code is pushed to this repo. This is the same action 
performed with my resume static website repo.
